<meta name="description" content="Disclosed herein is a patient transfer device comprising lifting arrangement positionable adjacent a patient and movable between a first position and a second position, and support arrangement for supporting the patient. The support arrangement is attachable to the lifting arrangement along a number of anchor locations thereon, the anchor locations including a pair of central anchor locations, a first pair of outer anchor locations on one side of the pair of central anchor locations and a second pair of outer anchor locations on an opposite side of the central pair of anchor locations; the support arrangement including a pair of central contact locations near a central location on the body of the patient, a first pair of outer contact locations on one side of the pair of central contact locations and a second pair of outer contact locations on an opposite side of the central pair of contact locations. The support arrangement is operable with the lifting arrangement for joining each of the anchor locations to a corresponding one of the contact locations, so as to transfer the patient between an inclined position and an upright orientation when the lifting arrangement moves between the first and second positions.">
