<meta name="description" content="A cooking machine control system for controlling the consumption of fuel by gas cooking machines, and gas flow valves usable in such cooking machine control systems. The cooking machine control system maintains the cooking surface of the cooking machine at an appropriate standby temperature when no food is being cooked, brings the cooking surface to an appropriate temperature to cook the food, and then returns the cooking surface to the standby gas flow rate. The system can be returned to the standby gas flow rate either after the cooking gas flow rate has been provided for sufficient time for the food to have cooked or after the temperature of the food has reached the desired level. With the cooking machine control system in the standby mode, when food is to be cooked a switch is actuated, applying a start signal to cause a valve to open the cooking flow rate path to cook the food, following which the valve returns the system to the standby mode. In another embodiment, the cooking machine control system includes a first gas pipe which provides gas to each burner of the cooking machine at the standby gas flow rate and a second gas pipe which in the standby mode is closed by a valve. When food is to be cooked, the start signal opens the valve to provide gas to each burner at a rate sufficient to bring the cooking surface to the appropriate cooking temperature.">
